# Shiny python with Svelte

This app is a quick demo of using the [shiny python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/) framework with a custom UI written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (although any JS framework could be used).

To try it out:

1. clone this repo
2. run `yarn` (install from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) if needed)
3. run `yarn build` to populate the `./dist/build/www` directory
4. launch the app with `shiny run --reload app.py --port 8000 `
